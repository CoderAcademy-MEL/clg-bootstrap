## What is Bootstrap?

## Linking Bootstrap to your Project
[Bootstrap Getting Started](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)  
Bootstrap is primarly a CSS Framework however some components require extra JavaScript librarys to work. A list of these components can be found at the link above. For today we will just be using the CSS file.  
To add Bootstrap to our project. Open the demo folder open index.html and add this inside of the `<head>` tag.  
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-SI27wrMjH3ZZ89r4o+fGIJtnzkAnFs3E4qz9DIYioCQ5l9Rd/7UAa8DHcaL8jkWt" crossorigin="anonymous">```   
This works in the same manor as we have been using to add our local css files, only this time it is linking to a resource that is stored in the cloud.
You should see that once we add this link and refresh our page our pages style has been updated.
